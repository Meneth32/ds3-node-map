#Introduction
This is a node map to Dark Souls 3, written in Dot and rendered by Graphviz.

The map was written during a first playthrough of the game.
The author hopes it may be useful to others.

#Technicalities
"Node" refers to a self-contained location within the game.
Routes between nodes are represented by edges.

Routes are marked with the "forward" arrow when either:

* The route is one-way, like dropping down from a ledge onto a lower platform, or
* The route is initially locked and must be opened from the other side.

Some nodes have the "box" shape. These are places that appear rectangular within the game.

Loot is marked on the map if that loot is considered important.
Weapons, clothes and other unique items are considered important, but consumables are not.

The map may be incomplete or incorrect. Additions and corrections are welcome.
